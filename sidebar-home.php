<!--	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>neverblog.net is a repository for things I find interesting, want to share with others, or expect I'll need to find later on. It's also a bit of a soapbox for me to voice my opinions on just about anything, although reviews tend to focus on technology, movies, and companies with whom my experience was so good or bad that I feel the need to pontificate about it.</p>
